# Overview
If you have found this repository, I am assuming you have some specific need with your waybar. Outside of the specific usecase, these modules will be worse and you should just use the defualt. There are additional README files inside each folder that will explain the module, as well as result images from my setup.

# Notice
I do not guarentee these will function properly on your machine, and I am unlikely to provide any support. At best, this is a starting place to get a general idea of how to solve your issue. **Make sure you nderstand how to resotre the defualt module before replacing it.**

# Files
currently this repository only has one modified waybar module: clock
